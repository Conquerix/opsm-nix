# Secret management with 1Password

`opsm-nix` (TODO: name) provides out-of-band secrets management for NixOS using items from a
1Password vault.
It uses [1Password Service Accounts](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts)
to access the vault without the need for additional services.
